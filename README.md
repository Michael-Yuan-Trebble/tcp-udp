# tcp-udp

## A Server and Client TCP Program

This C++ Project is for me to get used to the Winsock2 library and how servers and clients interact with each other. The client rolls a dice and and the server compares, sending the result back. I don't plan to do anything with this project specifically, but to use TCP and UDP in future programs.
